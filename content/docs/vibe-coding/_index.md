_Created by the Business Central Community, Enhanced for AI-powered AL Development_

# Vibe Coding for AL

Welcome to the **Vibe Coding for AL** initiative! This section contains AI-optimized coding rules and guidelines specifically designed to enhance the AL developer experience in modern AI-powered IDEs like VS Code and Cursor.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding represents a new approach to coding guidelines that are specifically formatted and structured to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants. These rules are designed to:

- **Enhance AI Understanding**: Provide clear, structured guidelines that AI agents can easily parse and apply
- **Improve Code Quality**: Maintain high standards while leveraging AI assistance
- **Standardize Practices**: Create consistent coding patterns across the AL development community
- **Boost Productivity**: Help developers write better code faster with AI assistance

## Key Features

### üìã **Structured Rule Format**
All rules are provided in markdown format with clear structure that AI agents can easily understand and apply during development.

### üîÑ **Community-Driven**
Built and maintained by the AL community, including MVPs and the Microsoft product team.

### üõ†Ô∏è **IDE Integration**
Future AL extension support will allow generating local rules files directly in VS Code and Cursor.

### ü§ñ **AI-Ready**
Designed as a foundation for AL-focused AI tools and Model Context Protocols (MCPs).

## How to Use

1. **Browse the Rules**: Explore the various rule categories below
2. **Copy for Your Project**: Use these rules as templates for your own coding standards
3. **Contribute**: Submit your own rule variations via pull requests
4. **Stay Updated**: Watch for AL extension integration coming soon

## Rule Categories

The Vibe Coding rules are organized into logical categories to make them easy to find and implement:

- **[Complete AL Guidelines Rules](al-guidelines-rules/)** - Comprehensive rules file with references to other rules
- **[AL Code Style & Formatting](al-code-style/)** - Indentation, folder organization, and code documentation
- **[AL Naming Conventions](al-naming-conventions/)** - File naming, object naming, and variable naming patterns
- **[AL Performance Optimization](al-performance/)** - Query optimization, temporary tables, and performance analysis
- **[AL Error Handling & Troubleshooting](al-error-handling/)** - Try/catch patterns, debugging, and telemetry integration
- **[AL Event-Driven Development](al-events/)** - Event subscribers, integration events, and extensibility patterns
- **[AL Testing & Project Structure](al-testing/)** - AL-Go workspace structure, test generation, and project organization

## Getting Started

To get started with Vibe Coding for AL:

1. Review the rule categories that apply to your development needs
2. Adapt the rules to your specific project requirements
3. Configure your AI assistant to use these guidelines
4. Share your experiences and contribute improvements back to the community

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ
