## Abstract
The goal of this pattern is to simplify the solution of similar problems and make your code more readable.

## Problem
In nearly every app you sometimes have to solve similar problems for different cases. Mostly not the same developer will solve every case. This results in different solutions.

## Description
The pattern is used when you have problems which are independent but require the same logical flow. Examples which occur very often are: _Posting Documents_, _Printing Reports_ or _Exporting Data_. 

## Bad Code Example
```al
codeunit 50010 ExportSalesLines
{
    procedure ExportData(SalesHeader: Record "Sales Header", SalesLine : Record "Sales Line")
    begin
        if not SalesHeader.CheckData() then
          exit;
        repeat
          case SalesHeader.ExportType of
            Enum::ExportType::A:
              GenerateLineTypeA(SalesLine);
            Enum::ExportType::B:
              GenerateLineTypeB(SalesLine);
          end;
        until SalesLine.Next() = 0;
        
        case SalesHeader.ExportType of
          Enum::ExportType::A:
            WriteToFile();
          Enum::ExportType::B:
            SendToWebService();
        end;
    end;

    //TODO Implementation of procedures used in example
}
```
As you can see in this example the readability gets worse with every new case.

## The Pattern
To implement the Pattern you need at least 3 objects:
- A template codeunit
- An Interface which provides the needed procedures
- A codeunit which Implements the interrface

In my example I show how to implement a data export with templating.

We start with the template
```al
codeunit 50000 ExportTemplate
{
    procedure ExportData(Export: Interface IDataExport)
    begin
        if not Export.CheckData() then
            exit;
        if Export.GetLinesToExport() then 
            repeat
                Export.ExportLine();
            until not Export.NextLine();
        Export.Finish();
    end;
}
```
As you can see the template just calls procedures via an interface and just defines the flow of the export without really implementing it.

As the second part we need an interface for the export functions
```al
interface IDataExport
{
    procedure CheckData(): Boolean
    procedure GetLinesToExport(): Boolean
    procedure ExportLine()
    procedure NextLine(): Boolean
    procedure Finish()
}
```

And now we need an implementation. For my example I wrote a export Codeunit for Sales Headers
```al
codeunit 50001 SalesHeaderExport implements IDataExport
{
    procedure SetSalesHeader(DocType: Enum "Sales Document Type"; No: Code[10])
    begin
        SalesHeader.Get(DocType, No);
    end;

    procedure CheckData(): Boolean
    begin
        SalesHeader.TestField(Status, Enum::"Sales Document Status"::Released);
    end;

    procedure GetLinesToExport(): Boolean
    begin
        SalesLines.SetRange("Document Type", SalesHeader."Document Type");
        SalesLines.SetRange("Document No.", SalesHeader."No.");
        exit(SalesLines.FindSet());
    end;

    procedure ExportLine()
    begin
        //Generate Exportdata here
    end;

    procedure NextLine(Steps : integer): Boolean
    begin
        exit(SalesLines.Next(Steps) <> 0);
    end;

    procedure Finish()
    begin
        // Send or Save data here
    end;

    var
        SalesHeader: Record "Sales Header";
        SalesLines: Record "Sales Line";
}
```

Now lets have a look how to use the pattern
```al
codeunit 50002 ExportOrders
{
    procedure ExportOrder(DocType: Enum "Sales Document Type"; No: Code[10])
    var
        Export: Codeunit ExportTemplate;
        ExportImpl: Codeunit SalesHeaderExport;
        ExportInt: Interface IDataExport;
    begin
        ExportImpl.SetSalesHeader(DocType, No);
        ExportInt := exportImpl;
        Export.ExportData(exportInt);
    end;
}
```

## Benefits
Your code gains readability and it is very easy to add new cases for the template. You don't always have to think about the whole logic. You just have to implement the details.

## When not to use
The Pattern should not be used for problems which differ too much. For example, if you have two data exports in your app, one is exporting header and lines and the second one only export header. In this case I would suggest to not use the pattern or to make two templates out of it.
