_Created by Microsoft, Described by waldo_

Only use begin..end to enclose [compound statements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/compound-statement-c?view=msvc-170#:~:text=A%20compound%20statement%20%28also%20called%20a%20%22block%22%29%20typically,appear%20at%20the%20head%20of%20a%20compound%20statement.).

## Example 1

### Bad code

```AL
if FindSet() then begin
    repeat
        ...
    until next() = 0;
end;
```

### Good code

```AL
if FindSet() then
    repeat
        ...
    until next() = 0;
```

## Example 2

### Bad code

```AL
if IsAssemblyOutputLine then begin
    TestField("Order Line No.", 0);
end;
```

### Good code

```AL
if IsAssemblyOutputLine then
    TestField("Order Line No.", 0);
```

## Exception

```AL
// Except for this case
if X then begin
    if Y then 
        //DO SOMETHING;
end else 
    (not X)
```

## Tips

The [AZ AL Dev Tools/AL Code Outline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andrzejzwierzchowski.al-code-outline) extension adds two new commands to Visual Studio Code to remove begin..end around single statements.

- `Remove Begin..End around Single Statements from the Active Editor` : removes begin..end around single statement from the current editor
- `Remove Begin..End around Single Statements from the Active Project` : removes begin..end around single statement from the current project
