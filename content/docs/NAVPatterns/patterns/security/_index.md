## **Security patterns for NAV**

### **Problem statement**

When sensitive data is stored inside the Dynamics NAV database, if negligently handled, it can become vulnerable. Particularly, the location, access and the state of the data are critical.

Use the following patterns to enhance security on your NAV system.

1. [Sensitive Data Encapsulation][anchor0]
2. [Data Encryption][anchor1]
3. [Single Point of Access][anchor2]
4. [Masked Text][anchor3]
5. [SSL in NAV][anchor4]
