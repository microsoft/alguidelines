Some of the software development practices, had **not** stood the test of time. Despite that, some are still being used today by developers everywhere.

"An **anti-pattern** (or **antipattern**) is a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive" (from [Wikipedia][anchor0])

Since almost the beginning of the NAV Design Patterns project, we talked about documenting the anti-patterns - but never found the time. Until, spontaneously, the April 1st 2015 article had practically wrote itself in a couple of hours, with priceless contributions coming from Andreas, Elly, Nikola - and last but not least, waldo.
