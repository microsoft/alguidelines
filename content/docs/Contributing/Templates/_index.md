We have created some template-files that you can simply copy and use.  Look at them as "Patterns for describing patterns"

We currently offer the following templates:

- for [Patterns](/contributing/templates/patterns/) ([raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/alguidelines/main/content/docs/Contributing/Templates/Patterns/index.md))
- for [Best Practice](/contributing/templates/bestpractice/) ([raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/alguidelines/main/content/docs/Contributing/Templates/BestPractice/index.md))

opening the "raw" link, will allow for the best copy/paste result.
