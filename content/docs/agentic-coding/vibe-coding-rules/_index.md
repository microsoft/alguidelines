# Vibe Coding Rules for AL

Welcome to the **Vibe Coding Rules for AL** initiative! This section contains AI-optimized coding rules and guidelines specifically designed to enhance the AL developer experience in modern AI-powered IDEs like VS Code and Cursor.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding represents a new approach to coding guidelines that are specifically formatted and structured to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants. These rules are designed to:

- **Enhance AI Understanding**: Provide clear, structured guidelines that AI agents can easily parse and apply
- **Improve Code Quality**: Maintain high standards while leveraging AI assistance
- **Standardize Practices**: Create consistent coding patterns across the AL development community
- **Boost Productivity**: Help developers write better code faster with AI assistance

## Key Features

### 📋 **Structured Rule Format**
All rules are provided in markdown format with clear structure that AI agents can easily understand and apply during development.

### 🔄 **Community-Driven**
Built and maintained by the AL community, including MVPs and the Microsoft product team.

### 🛠️ **IDE Integration**
Future AL extension support will allow generating local rules files directly in VS Code and Cursor.

### 🤖 **AI-Ready**
Designed as a foundation for AL-focused AI tools and Model Context Protocols (MCPs).

## How to Use

1. **Browse the Rules**: Explore the various rule categories below
2. **Copy for Your Project**: Use these rules as templates for your own coding standards
3. **Contribute**: Submit your own rule variations via pull requests
4. **Stay Updated**: Watch for AL extension integration coming soon

## Rule Categories

The Vibe Coding rules are organized into logical categories to make them easy to find and implement:

- **[Complete AL Guidelines Rules](al-guidelines-rules/)** - Comprehensive rules file with references to other rules
- **[AL Code Style & Formatting](al-code-style/)** - Indentation, folder organization, and code documentation
- **[AL Naming Conventions](al-naming-conventions/)** - File naming, object naming, and variable naming patterns
- **[AL Performance Optimization](al-performance/)** - Query optimization, temporary tables, and performance analysis
- **[AL Error Handling & Troubleshooting](al-error-handling/)** - Try/catch patterns, debugging, and telemetry integration
- **[AL Event-Driven Development](al-events/)** - Event subscribers, integration events, and extensibility patterns
- **[AL Testing & Project Structure](al-testing/)** - AL-Go workspace structure, test generation, and project organization
