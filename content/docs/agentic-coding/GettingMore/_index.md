  Practical examples and advanced techniques for AI-assisted AL development
---

This section provides hands-on examples of how to use AI assistants for common AL development tasks. Each guide walks through a realistic scenario with step-by-step instructions and prompts.

## In This Section

- **[AI-Assisted Code Review](code-review)** - Use AI to review code for quality, performance, and best practices
- **[Generating Documentation](documentation)** - Automatically create and maintain documentation for your AL code
- **[Adding Telemetry](telemetry)** - Instrument your extensions with Application Insights telemetry
- **[Refactoring Legacy Code](refactoring)** - Modernize and improve existing AL code
- **[Writing Tests](testing)** - Create comprehensive test coverage with AI assistance

## How to Use These Guides

Each guide follows a practical, scenario-based approach:

1. **Scenario**: A realistic development task
2. **Goal**: What you're trying to achieve
3. **Step-by-Step**: Detailed instructions with actual prompts
4. **Review Points**: What to check in the AI-generated code
5. **Tips**: Additional insights and variations
