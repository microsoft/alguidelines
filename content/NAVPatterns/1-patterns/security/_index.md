## **Security patterns for NAV**

### **Problem statement**

When sensitive data is stored inside the Dynamics NAV database, if negligently handled, it can become vulnerable. Particularly, the location, access and the state of the data are critical.

1. [Sensitive Data Encapsulation][anchor0]
2. [Data Encryption][anchor1]
3. [Single Point of Access][anchor2]
4. [Masked Text][anchor3]
5. [SSL in NAV][anchor4]
