## Description
The `if..then` pair, `while..do` pair, and `for..do` pair must appear on the same line or the same level of indentation.  If possible, you can align the lines it is even much more readable.

## Bad code

```al
    if (x = y) and
      (a = b) then
```

## Good code

```al
    if (x = y) and
       (a = b) 
    then
```
