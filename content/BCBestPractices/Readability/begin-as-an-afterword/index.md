## Description

When `begin` follows `then`, `else`, `do`, it should be on the same line, preceded by one space character. 

## Bad code

```al
    if ICPartnerRefType = ICPartnerRefType::"Common Item No." then
    begin
    ...
    end;
```

## Good code

```al
    if ICPartnerRefType = ICPartnerRefType::"Common Item No." then begin
    ...
    end;
```
